Type (Renewable Energy Projects) UNFCCC Methodology AMS-I.D: “Grid
connected renewable electricity generation”, Version 18

UCR Protocol Standard Baseline

The wind farm is owned by Gujarat Fluorochemicals Limited., (GFL- Project Proponent or PP), which is a
subsidiary of Inox Wind Ltd (IWL) and Inox Green Energy Service Ltd (IGESL), which is a part of Inox
GFL Group. The Group is an Indian conglomerate with a legacy of more than 90 years. The group is a
forerunner in diversified business segments comprising Fluor polymers, Specialty Chemicals, Wind Energy,
and Renewable in various geographies. The total installed capacity of the GFL Wind Project is 4 MW wind
power project in Rajkot & Amreli district of Gujarat. The GFL Wind Projects consists of 2 WTGs of 2.0
MW each. The entire Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) are provided by Inox Wind Ltd &
Operations and Maintenance (O&M) services are provided by Inox Green Energy Service Ltd.

The generated electricity from the WTGs is grid connected wind power project located in Veraval village of
Rajkot & Kidi village of Amreli District in the state of Gujarat (India). The purpose of this plant installation
to supply electricity to regional GETCO Grid or wheeled for captive consumption through wheeling into the
grid and M/s has the full ownership of the project activity. The wind power projects are operational
activities with continuous reduction of GHGs, currently being applied for voluntary carbon offset units
(CoUs) under “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR). The commissioning date of the first WTG considered
as the start date of the project activity and is recorded as (08.10.2013 )

In the absence of the project activity, electricity would have been delivered to the grid by the operation of
fossil fuel-based grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new fossil fuel- based generation
sources in the Grid. As is the nature of wind projects (renewable energy), no fossil fuel is involved for
power generation in the project activity. The electricity produced by the project is directly contributing to
climate change mitigation by reducing the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs, i.e., CO2)
into the atmosphere by displacing an equivalent amount of power at grid.
